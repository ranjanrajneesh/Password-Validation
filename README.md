### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Write a password validation service, meant to be configurable via IoC (using dependency injection engine of your choice).  The service is meant to check a text string for compliance to any number of password validation rules.  The rules currently known are:

* Must consist of a mixture of lowercase letters and numerical digits only, with at least one of each.
* Must be between 5 and 12 characters in length.
* Must not contain any sequence of characters immediately followed by the same sequence.

### ASSUMPTIONS
* We continue to validate password with other rules when one of the rules is failed. 
* No need to consider order of rules
* Internationalization is not required for this application


### IMPLEMENTATION
* using Spring Boot for rapid application ddevelopment.
* using Spring IOC container for Dependency Injection 
* using Maven as a build tool.<br>
  `mvn clean install -DskipTests=true` will build the app and create the jar jar file in application target folder.
  `mvn clean test` will run all unit tests.
  `mvn clean install` will run integration testing and fail valid business test scenario.
 * `PasswordValidationRule` is the inteface we need to implement to add a new validation rule.
* `PasswordValidationService` is the service where we inject all the validation rules and validate the password.
* For dynamically enabling/disabling rules, we can configure rules in `application.properties` file with `password.validation.rules` property. Only the rules specified with this property are applied during password validation.
* Password min and max length are configurable in `application.properties` file. Default value for min length is 5 and max value is 12.
* Implemented `PasswordValidationController` as client for password validation service. Its a Rest controller.
